# Rust Wheel
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/rustwheel/)

Rust Wheel was designed to record data from the Roulette Wheel in the game Rust. There were rumors of it not being completely random and instead having some pattern or auto balancing system in place but it proved difficult and time consuming to record the results manually to verify the rumors.

My current consensus after using the Rust Wheel logger for a period of time is that the results are indeed random and cannot be predicted.
